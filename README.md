## aws-azure-login-wrapped
Its wrapper of aws-azure-login to update default profile in credentials. 

## Idea 
This tool is awesome https://github.com/sportradar/aws-azure-login but lacks of option to save credentials in to default profile. 
Which is required for some tools like Terraform to function.

## Usage
